# Json Parser 

My take on [Write Your Own JSON Parser | Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-json-parser/) by John Crickett using JS

## How the project works?
- This project is a script that checks whether an object is a valid "JSON" object or not.
- There are group of test folders that contain a set of valid and invalid objects, and the script will tell you which one is valid.

## How to run the project
  - Clone the project
  - `npm install`
  - `npm start`

- You can choose which test you want to teparse by uncommenting it in app-test.js file.
- Then run the command `node app-test` in the terminal 

## Resources used 

Thisa are the main resources I have used to help me build the json parser.
